An open-source block-based exploration rpg game, totally a work in progress.  Right now still working on the basics.

To build on UNIX-like environment:
	./build.sh (requires a modern gcc, desktop opengl, and sdl2-dev)
To build for android (even more broken):
	read build_android.sh and set all the console variables you need to (there are defaults for everything except ANDROID_SDK which should point to the root path).
	./build-android.sh
